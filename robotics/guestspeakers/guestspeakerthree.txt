A cosmic ray shower is when different particles break down and hit with the surface of the Earth. This causes the muons to break down within the atmosphere. GSU  built a low cost detector to find higher counts of muons in the atmosphere. However, there are many other particles in the atmosphere which come by with the cosmic shower. The guest speaker's research posed the following question, "can a cubesat be used to detect these different types of particles?" The prototype works by using a rasberry pi with a radio communication module that will send data using those radio waves. A future consideration that needs to be taken into effect is the fact that there is noise that can occur in that high of an altitude that make it harder to send accurate information. Once the ground station recieves the information, it is time stamped and stored into the cloud. The cloud storage is built on a mysql database and it is published on a kibana dashboard for plotting. The outputted data showed that as pressure goes up, the probability of rain occurs. In a big picture, the cube sat can be used for more accurate weather prediction.
