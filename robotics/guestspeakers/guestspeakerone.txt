The focus robot was created to find radon release. The testing for the robot was done at Stone Mountain. The purpose for finding radon release would be to aid in housing development, since this is a toxic gas. Originally, teams would go to the site in person and place pipes underground to measure release, but this proved to be time consuming. However, issues for creating the robot would arise as well. Two big issues was that it would run into network and power issues with how remote the site was. When creatinga  robot it is important to take into consideration the different parts available and which part would be best necessary for the robot. There are many different types of motors, sensors, and drives that can be used. Engineering perspectives and critical thinking is important within the field of robotics. With the given example, the basic steps for building a robot have been reintroduced and better understood.
