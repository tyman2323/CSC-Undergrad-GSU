# Example Datasets
All included datasets are TINY

General practice for learning
- Create a GCS bucket in the same project as your GCP Dataproc Hadoop cluster
- Upload TINY example datasets
- Make the bucket (or the individual files) public - set `AllUsers` read permission

Datasets and Course Lessons
- Use `shakespeare.raw` for WordCount examples in Java, Scala or PySpark
- Use `SalesJan2009.csv` or `timesheet.csv` for Hive/HQL examples
- Use `drivers.csv` for PIG examples
