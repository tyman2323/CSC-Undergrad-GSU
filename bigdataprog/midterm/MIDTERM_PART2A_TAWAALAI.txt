24. Are the top scorers also the top defenders? 
Consider what it would be like if it were your job to look at data like this and make decisions about the best players? Is it always a clear choice? The top scorers are typically not the top defenders. However, they score really well on defense even if they are not the top. The decision I would make would be based on what metric the "best" is being determined now.

26. SELECT name, weight_lbs, defending FROM soccer_data ORDER BY finishing DESC and SELECT name, weight_lbs, defending FROM soccer_data ORDER BY finishing DESC show that better defending players typically weigh more but there is no impact on attacking.
SELECT name, mentality, aggression, vision FROM soccer_data ORDER BY finishing DESC shows that vision and aggression do play a hand in one another for who has a stronger mentality.
